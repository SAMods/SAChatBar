SMF 2.0x - Chat Bar

Developed for SMF forums c/o SA @ http://www.facebook.com/devsamods

SA Chat bar software integrates with SMF and works with SMF without working within SMF. This is done by loading the SMF cookie from the browser and verifying it against data saved in the database. This way of working allows SA Chat to run inside and outside of SMF and throughout your website as long as the user is logged into SMF.

The integration codes can be put into any html code. One in the head and one in the body. The install script however installs the JavaScript codes by default in the default theme, but you can add these codes into whatever template you like SMF or not.

here is so far a quite bit of possibilities left for you to explore with the custom template and chat sound system SA Chat has to offer. I am looking forward to what theme designers might have to add to this equation.

You can also customize how SA Chat works from the SMF Admin Panel. You can set the chat heart beat, message window heart beat and set how many days until the chat purges old messages.

SA Chat also comes with share links to MySpace, Facebook and Twitter. This allows your site visitors to post the page they are at to any of these social networks.

In the Who's Online section of the chat you will see all of your buddies. Just click on a buddy to start a chat session.
